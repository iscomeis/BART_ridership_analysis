# BART Project

In this project, we will analyze the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system in San Francisco to determine which station has the highest ridership and at what times of the day passengers can sit comfortably during their journeys.

We will seek answers to the following Data Analytics questions:

- **Which BART station is the busiest?**
- **What is the least popular BART route?**
- **When is the best time to go to San Francisco from Berkeley if you want to find a seat?**
- **Which day of the week is the busiest?**
- **How many people take the BART late at night?**

After answering these questions, we will calculate the distances between each station and build a deep learning regression model that can predict the number of people commuting to work by BART between any two stations. Following this, we will address the following questions:

- **How would you approach that?**
- **What additional data would you need?**
- **How would you want the city or BART officials to use your data?**

This dataset contains BART data from the years 2016 and 2017. It includes station names, addresses, and the number of passengers who boarded each station on various dates.

The dataset used for this project has been provided by the BART organization and is obtained from kaggle.com.
